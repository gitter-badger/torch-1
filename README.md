# torch
## Full-stack MVC franework for production-ready apps 

#### What I'm looking for?
torch is a typescript nodejs framework which can also cure cancer  
With torch you worry less about making your app complete and more about building a freature-rich web-server app  
torch takes care of stuff like authentication, session, security, static-files, databases to mention a few  
torch abstracts away those things that make your web-server app complete 


#### Contribute 
torch is still in development if you want to contribute read [CONTRIBUTION](./CONTRIBUTION.md)
